# Research data

- We use [Apache JMeter](https://jmeter.apache.org/) to execute load and performance testing. This testing tool is able to send the HTTP request to a web server. 
- Service registration and file hash uploading are simulated during the experiment. 
- We evaluate system performance with two factors: 
  - request rate (Request Per Second, RPS) 
  - the number of nodes
